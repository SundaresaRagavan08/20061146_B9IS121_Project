# Configuration Management with Ansible

### 1. **Local Control via Ansible**
Ansible is installed and run on your local machine. It uses **SSH** to connect to the remote EC2 instance.

### 2. **Inventory Configuration**
The file `inventory.ini` defines the target EC2 instance using its public IP address and SSH key. This tells Ansible where to connect and how.

### 3. **Playbook Execution**
The Ansible playbook install_docker.yml is run with the command:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_docker.yml
```

### 4. **Tasks Run on EC2**

- Ensures the latest package list is fetched before installing anything.
- Installs the Docker engine from Ubuntu's official repositories.
- Ensures Docker starts immediately and also on future reboots.
- Adds the default ubuntu user to the Docker group so it can run Docker without sudo.

### 5. **To Verify**

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2key.pem ubuntu@18.201.41.54
docker --version
docker ps
```
